1. What is DDL, DCL & DML?
Ans:
DML (Data Manipulation Language)

->DML statements affect records in a table. These are basic operations we perform on data such as selecting a few records from a table, inserting new records, deleting unnecessary records, and updating/modifying existing records.
DML statements include the following:
SELECT – select records from a table
INSERT – insert new records
UPDATE – update/Modify existing records
DELETE – delete existing records


->DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL statements are used to alter/modify a database or table structure and schema. These statements handle the design and storage of database objects.
CREATE – create a new Table, database, schema
ALTER – alter existing table, column description
DROP – delete existing objects from database


->DCL (Data Control Language)

DCL statements control the level of access that users have on database objects.
GRANT – allows users to read/write on certain database objects
REVOKE – keeps users from read/write permission on database objects

2. What is the difference between truncate and delete?
Ans:
DROP & TRUNCATE statement both are DDL, or Data Definition Languages. - DROP statement is used to delete or remove a table from a database. - TRUNCATE statement is used to delete/remove all records form a table, the table still exists in the database.

3. What is the use of alter table?
Ans:
The MySQL ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, modify, or drop/delete columns in a table. The MySQL ALTER TABLE statement is also used to rename a table.

4. Explain about having by, order by, group by clause
Ans:
->ORDER BY Clause
* SELECT returns records in no particular  order.
* To ensure a specific order use the ORDER BY  clause.
* ORDER BY allows sorting by one or more  columns.
* Records can be returned in ascending or  descending order.

->GROUP BY Clause
* The GROUP BY clause groups records into  summary rows.
* GROUP BY returns one records for each group.
* GROUP BY typically also involves aggregates: COUNT, MAX, SUM, AVG, etc.
* GROUP BY can group by one or more columns.

->HAVING Clause
* HAVING filters records that work on  summarized GROUP BY results.
* HAVING applies to summarized group records,  whereas WHERE applies to individual records.
* Only the groups that meet the HAVING criteria  will be returned.
* HAVING requires that a GROUP BY clause is  present.
*WHERE and HAVING can be in the same query.
